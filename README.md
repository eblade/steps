Graphical Live Sequencer

This project came about because I want to have a really felxible sequencer. I like the idea of Ableton Push, but it's quite expensive, and still, when I run into the wall, it's not going to move. Plus I like Vim, so why not create something in between?

Steps is:

* A versatile MIDI sequencer.
* Touch controlled, like a mobile app, sort of.
* Keyboard controlled, like vim, sort of.

Steps is not:

* A synth.
* Ready for any kind of use.
